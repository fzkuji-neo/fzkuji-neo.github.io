An autonomous GUI agent: give it a task and it drives real desktop applications and
OSWorld VMs by vision alone — no accessibility tree, no application APIs.

The grounding method behind it is [GUI-Lens](/publication/2026-08-04-GUI-Lens): rather
than asking a vision-language model to predict a click coordinate in one shot, the agent
extracts OCR text and detected UI components as coordinate references, then narrows the
search region through successive observations. This matters on dense, high-resolution
interfaces, where a model often recognizes the control it wants without locating it
precisely enough to click.

Built as an installable harness on top of [OpenProgram](/portfolio/1-openprogram), so the
perception loop is ordinary Python while the model supplies only visual judgement.
